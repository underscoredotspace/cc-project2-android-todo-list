# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## To-Do List

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task.
Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.

### Project Extensions

* Allow the user to prioritise and/or categorise tasks
* Use the calendar to set due dates on tasks.

## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9.:15 am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
